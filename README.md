# CivGuide
Basic guide plugin for Civcraft. Supports chat guides as well as guide books

Note when developing for CivGuide: You will need to add an actual spigot server jar as a dependency or you will get an error in the HoverTextMessage class

Currently not a lot configured, just a few events as an example, ill let ttk tell me what he wants before i do more
